    "Python is a simple to learn yet powerful programming language that was conceived in the late 1980s and nowadays is a widely used programming language backed with a huge community. There are hundreds of modules that can be used for free for almost anything you might need to do. And YES, you can write and run python in the Raspberry Pi, and there are modules that allow us to interact with the GPIO ports, the camera, etc."
