    "# ARM assembler in Raspberry Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine language is built up from discrete statements or instructions implemented by a particular processor. ARM is a family of instruction set architectures for computer processors and is the one used by the processor of the Raspberry Pi. The machine language is interpreted by the computer in term of binary codes. Binary code is what a computer can run. It is composed of instructions, that are encoded in a binary representation (such encodings are documented in the ARM manuals). You could write binary code encoding instructions but that would be painstaking. So instead we will write assembler language. Assembler language is just a thin syntax layer on top of the binary code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the computer cannot run assembler we have to get binary code from it. We use a tool called, well, assembler to assemble the assembler code into a binary code that we can run. The tool to do this is called `as`. In particular GNU Assembler, which is the assembler tool from the GNU project, sometimes it is also known as `gas` for this reason. This is the tool we will use to assemble our programs."

    "We made things easier by using an emulated processor. Although the Raspberry Pi 5 we are using has 64-bit ARM architecture, this notebook emulates an ARM Cortex M3 processor, which is a 32-bit ARM processor. We wrote a simple assembly program that only assigns `2` to `r0` and then we inspected the value of registers.\n",

If it is not global, it will not be callable by the C runtime and the linking phase will fail.\n",

The instruction itself is written in ARM assembly language. In the example above, we are simply defining the `main` label without any associated instruction.\n",

ARM syntax places the destination on the left, so the command reads as \"move the immediate value `2` into register `r0`\" (this effectively overwrites whatever register `r0` may have at that point). We'll cover more about registers and immediate values in the next chapter.\n",

    "## Registers\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a processor in a computer is nothing but a powerful calculator. Calculations can only be carried using values stored in very tiny memories called registers. The ARM processor in a Cortex M3 has 16 integer registers and 32 floating point registers. A processor uses these registers to perform integer computations and floating point computations, respectively. We will put floating registers aside for now and eventually we will get back to them in a future installment. Let’s focus on the integer registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARM processors have 16 integer registers, named `r0` to `r15`. Registers `r0`-`r12` are 32-bit general purpose registers. However, `r13`-`r15` are unique registers to serve specific purposes: `r13` contains two stack pointers, `r14` is the link register, and `r15` is the program counter. In this lab, we won’t need many registers; at most, we will only use up to 3 registers. That said, it is convenient to represent integers in two's complement as there are instructions which perform computations assuming this encoding. So from now, except noted, we will assume our registers contain integer values encoded in two's complement."

    "Some of the instructions for the ARM assembler are different from the ones for x86 covered in lecture. One such difference is that many instructions now have an explicit destination register, rather an implicit one. For example, the addition instruction `add` takes 3 operands instead of 2 – the first is the destination register where the result will be stored, and the next two operands are the numbers you want to add together, e.g. if you want to sore the result of `r1 + r2` in the register `r0`, you would use:\n",
